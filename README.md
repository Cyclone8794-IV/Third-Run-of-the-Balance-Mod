# Third-Run-of-the-Balance-Mod
A balance mod for Airships: Conquer the Skies, and probably the thing that makes new modules.

This is also my first public repository, which will enable me to gain practice with using Git in the future. 
Why I didn't learn this earlier is utterly beyond me.

Anyway, the contributors to this balance mod are as follows:
Myself: The new modules for the Third Run
Bob: Returning modules from the second and first runs
Tatourmi: Mathematically calculating the precise numbers for balance.
YellowMiner: Does pretty much all the module art nowadays.
