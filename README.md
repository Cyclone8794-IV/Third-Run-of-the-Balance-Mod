# Third-Run-of-the-Balance-Mod
A balance mod for Airships: Conquer the Skies, and probably the thing that makes new modules.  

This is also my first public repository, which will enable me to gain practice with using Git in the future.  
Why I didn't learn this earlier is utterly beyond me.  

Anyway, the contributors to this balance mod are as follows:
